# DIODER-Controller
Code for controlling the IKEA DIODER LED strip with an Arduino and some extra hardware
(see http://makezine.com/projects/make-36-boards/android-arduino-led-strip-lights/ on how to make that)

This program is only meant for learning purposes, but you can use it anyway you want. I take no responsibility for any damage you do to your LED strip, Arduino board and/or other equipment.
This software is provided "as is" with no without any express or implied warranty of any kind.

Use the *_PIN fields to set the output/input pins.
